General usage:

<> mark placeholders, [] mark optionals

    -b/--break
        ignore all following transformers

    -cc/--cli-config <path/to/file>
        append cli config from file

    -e/--excepts <link1> [<link2> [...]]
        send exceptions from the previous transformer (if any) and uncaught downstream exceptions to the given links

    -f/--fetch [<name>]
        fetch value from stash

    -h/--help
        print this help and exit

    -jc/--json-config <path/to/file>
        append json config from file

    -l/--links <link1> [<link2> [...]]
        link the previous transformer to the given links,
        it will not automatically link to the next transformer

    -pc/--print-config
        print the configuration resulting from this cli interaction instead of executing it

    -r/--report
        the interval in seconds at which to report throughput, 0 to disable

    -rc/--resource-config </path/to/resource>
        append json config from resource

    -s/--stash [<name>]
        stash value

    -sf/--sync-from <link1> [<link2> [...]]
        mark the linked transformers to be synced with when -stt is used later

    -sft/--sync-from-transformer [<workers>] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        equal to -t but marks the transformer to be synced with when -stt is used later

    -stt/--sync-to-transformer [<workers>] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        equal to -t but syncs the transformer with those marked by -sf/-sft or the ingest-seed if there are no marks

    -t/--transformer [<workers>] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        add transformer to the pipeline
        provide [<workers>] to enable async execution for the transformer by the provided number of workers
        provide [<id>] to be able to refer to this transformer by the provided id
        provide [!] to enable throughput reporting for the transformer

    -w/--swap [<name>]
        swap value in stash

    --
        mark previous transformer as terminal, it will not automatically link to the next transformer
