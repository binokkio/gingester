Gingester - generic ingest framework

General usage:

<> mark placeholders, [] mark optionals

    -b/--break
        ignore all following transformers

    -cf/--cli-file <path/to/file> [<parameters>]
        include cli from file, supports Freemarker square-bracket-tag and square-bracket-interpolation templating
        provide [<parameters>] in JSON syntax to be used as template data

    -cr/--cli-resource <path/to/resource> [<parameters>]
        include cli from resource, supports Freemarker square-bracket-tag and square-bracket-interpolation templating
        provide [<parameters>] in JSON syntax to be used as template data

    -e/--excepts <link1> [<link2> [...]]
        send exceptions from the previous transformer (if any) and uncaught downstream exceptions to the given links

    -f/--fetch [<name>]
        fetch value from stash by name

    -fa/--fetch-all [<name>]
        fetch all values from stash by name

    -h/--help
        print this help and exit

    -l/--links <link1> [<link2> [...]]
        link the previous transformer to the given links,
        it will not automatically link to the next transformer

    -r/--report
        the interval in seconds at which to report throughput, 0 to disable

    -s/--stash [<name>]
        stash value

    -sf/--sync-from <link1> [<link2> [...]]
        mark the linked transformers to be synced with when -stt or -stft is used later

    -sft/--sync-from-transformer [[<workers>][.[<queueSize>][.<maxBatchSize>]]] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        equal to -t but marks the transformer to be synced with when -stt or -stft is used later

    -stft/--sync-to-and-from-transformer [[<workers>][.[<queueSize>][.<maxBatchSize>]]] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        equal to -t but syncs the transformer with those most recently marked by -sf, -sft or -stft, or the
        ingest-seed if there are no marks, also marks the transformer to be synced with when -stt or -stft is used later

    -stt/--sync-to-transformer [[<workers>][.[<queueSize>][.<maxBatchSize>]]] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        equal to -t but syncs the transformer with those most recently marked by -sf, -sft or -stft, or the
        ingest-seed if there are no marks

    -t/--transformer [[<workers>][.[<queueSize>][.<maxBatchSize>]]] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        add transformer to the pipeline
        provide [<workers>] to enable async execution for the transformer by the provided number of workers
        provide [<queueSize>] to set the queue size for this transformer
        provide [<maxBatchSize>] to limit the maximum batch size for this transformer
        provide [<id>] to be able to refer to this transformer by the provided id
        provide [!] to enable throughput reporting for the transformer
        provide [<parameters>] to configure the transformer

    -w/--swap [<name>]
        stash value and fetch previous value

    --
        prevent the previous transformer from automatically being linked to the next transformer
