<> mark placeholders, [] mark optionals

    -b/--break
        ignore all following transformers

    -e/--excepts <link1> [<link2> [...]]
        send exceptions from the previous transformer (if any) and uncaught downstream exceptions to the given links

    -f/--fetch [<name>]
        fetch value from stash

    -fc/--file-config/--from-config <path/to/file>
        append json config from file

    -h/--help
        print this help and exit

    -l/--links <link1> [<link2> [...]]
        link the previous transformer to the given links,
        it will not automatically link to the next transformer

    -r/--report
        the interval in seconds at which to report throughput, 0 to disable

    -pc/--print-config
        print the configuration resulting from this cli interaction instead of executing it

    -rc/--resource-config </path/to/resource>
        append json config from resource

    -s/--stash [<name>]
        stash value

    -sft/--sync-from-transformer [<workers>] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]

    -stt/--sync-to-transformer [<workers>] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        equals -t but syncs the transformer with the most recent use of -sft or if no -sft was given the ingest-seed

    -t/--transformer [<workers>] [<id>:]<name>[!] [<parameters>]
        add transformer to the pipeline
        provide [<workers>] to enable async execution for the transformer by the provided number of workers
        provide [<id>] to be able to refer to this transformer by the provided id
        provide [!] to enable throughput reporting for the transformer

    -w/--swap [<name>]
