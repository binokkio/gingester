<h1>Gingester Core</h1>
<p>
    The Gingester Core provides the Gingester framework, Command Line Interface, and Service Provider Interface.
    It is the only required dependency to run Gingester but does not include enough
    <a href="b/nana/technology/gingester/core/transformer/Transformer.html">transformers</a> to be useful on its own.
    A generally useful set of transformers is provided by Gingester Transformers Base.
    More specific transformers are provided in separate packages.
    Custom transformers can be added by implementing the
    <a href="b/nana/technology/gingester/core/transformer/Transformer.html">Transformer interface</a> and providing them
    to Gingester using the Java Service Provider Interface.
